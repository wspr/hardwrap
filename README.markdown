The HARDWRAP package
====================

This package facilitates wrapping plain text to a specific number of
characters per line, while breaking lines by words rather than, as done by
TeX, by characters.

The primary use for these facilities is to aid the generation of messages
sent to the log file or console output to display messages to the user.
Package authors may also find this useful when writing out arbitary text
to an external file.

For more information see the documentation hardwrap.pdf.
