The HARDWRAP package
=======================

This package provides facilities for hard-wrapping text to a certain line
width. The primary purpose is to make it easier for package authors to write
readable informational messages to the console and log file; wrappers around
\PackageWarning et al. are provided for this.  Package authors may also find
this useful when writing out arbitrary text to an external file.

For more information see the documentation hardwrap.pdf.
